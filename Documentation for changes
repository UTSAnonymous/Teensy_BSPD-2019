Documentation for CANBus input to BSPD

1. Control signal from Jetson

	1.1 CANbus ID = 0x144 (CANID_REMOTE_CONTROL)
	1.2 CANbus len = 3
	1.3 CANbus buf[0] = (enable or disable remote control) (1 = enable, 0 = disable)
	1.4 CANbus buf[1] = (Max speed (m/s or km/h) )
	1.5 CANbus buf[2] = (Speed)

2. New global variable

	2.1 Boolean remoteControlEnabled
	2.2 Int maxAllowedSpeed
	2.3 const int maxVehicleSpeed 		// This is the top speed of the vehicle
	2.3 Int speedVal
	2.4 int32_t throttleVal

3. Create new filter for CANID_REMOTE_CONTROL
	
	canFIlter.id = CANID_REMOTE_CONTROL;  //from jetson for remote control
	CANbus.setFilter(canFilter, 7);

4. In for loop, check for CANID_REMOTE_CONTROL messages

5. Modify readSensor function

6. Change the input in the sendThrottle function from sensorThrottle1Value to throttleVal
